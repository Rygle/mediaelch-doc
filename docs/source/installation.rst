It's easy to install MediaElch on Windows. First download MediaElch from the :doc:`download area <index>`.
Extract the ``zip`` to where you want to install MediaElch, e.g. to ``C:\Users\yourUserName\Desktop\MediaElch``.
That's it: You can now start ``MediaElch.exe`` and scrape movies, tv shows and more!

For portable mode see :doc:`Portable Mode <portable-mode>`.

Linux
=====

Currently only unstable AppImages are available. Download MediaElch from :doc:`download area <index>` and make
it executable with ``chmod +x MediaElch*.AppImage``. You can now start MediaElch ``./MediaElch*.AppImage``.

**Note**: The next stable version will also include `.deb` and `.rpm` packages that you can install
through your system's package manager.


macOS
=====

Download MediaElch from the :doc:`download area <index>` and open the ``.dmg`` file. In the new window
drag the MediaElch to the Applications folder. You can then start MediaElch from inside the Application
folder.

**Note**: You may have to adjust your system's security settings as MediaElch is not signed by
a registered developer.
